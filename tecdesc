## Technical Summary: BPE Framework
### Overview

The BPE Framework is a C++-based neural network framework designed for building and training language models with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. It implements a complete deep learning stack with automatic differentiation, optimization, and model serialization capabilities.
Core Components
#### 1. Tensor Operations with Autograd

    Header-only Tensor class with Eigen backend for efficient linear algebra

    Automatic differentiation with backward propagation

    Comprehensive operator support: element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, reductions

    Activation functions: ReLU, GELU, Softmax, Sigmoid with gradient support

    Memory-efficient implementation with shape-aware operations

#### 2. BPE Tokenizer

    PIMPL pattern implementation for API stability

    Efficient vocabulary management with merge operations

    Encoding/decoding support for text processing

    Non-copyable design (uses unique_ptr) for proper resource management

#### 3. Neural Network Architecture

    Transformer-based language model implementation

    Configurable dimensions: embedding size, hidden layers, attention heads

    Parameter management with named parameters for serialization

    Training/inference modes support

#### 4. Training Infrastructure

    Adam optimizer with configurable hyperparameters

    Gradient accumulation and moment estimation

    Batch processing with sequence padding

    Loss computation (cross-entropy) with masking support

#### 5. Model Serialization

    Binary format with versioning and magic number validation

    Parameter-by-name storage and retrieval

    Shape preservation and data integrity checks

    Error handling for file operations and format validation

### Key Technical Features
#### Memory Management

    Eigen integration for optimized matrix operations

    Shape-aware memory allocation preventing unnecessary copies

    RAII principles for resource management

#### Performance Considerations

    Header-only design for Tensor class enabling compiler optimizations

    Batch processing for efficient training

    In-place operations where possible to reduce memory overhead

#### Extensibility

    Modular architecture allowing component replacement

    Clear interfaces between tokenizer, model, and training components

    Parameter naming convention supporting complex architectures

#### Architecture Patterns

    PIMPL Idiom: Used in tokenizer for stable ABI

    RAII: Comprehensive resource management throughout

    Builder Pattern: Model configuration through constructor parameters

    Strategy Pattern: Optimizer implementation allowing algorithm changes

#### Current Capabilities

### Technical Stack

    C++17 with standard library components

    Eigen for linear algebra operations

    CMake for build system management

    Header-only design for core components

#### Usage Example

// Initialize components
BPETokenizer tokenizer(corpus);
LanguageModel model(tokenizer.vocab_size(), 512, 2048, 8);
LanguageModelTrainer trainer(tokenizer, 512, 2048, 8);

// Train model
trainer.train(training_corpus, 10, 32, 256);

trainer.save_model("language_model.bin");
